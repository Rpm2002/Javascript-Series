## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

                                                   Abstraction

The main purpose of Abstraction is to handle the complexity of the program by hiding unnecessary detail from the user. This allows users to implement advance logic without having to understand or to think about all the hidden complexity.
For instance, when you model a 'Car' class, you focus on its essential properties (like speed, color, and model) and behaviors (such as 'drive' or 'stop') without concerning yourself with the internal mechanics.                                                   

                                                   Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called a class; it keeps data both safe from outside interference and misuse. With Encapsulation, the data is not accessed directly. It can only be accessed through public functions present inside the class called methods. Encapsulation is achieved by keeping itâ€™s state private.           

                                                    Inheritance

 Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (called a child or subclass) is created by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a parent or superclass). This allows the child class to reuse the fields and methods of the parent class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes. For instance, you might have a 'Vehicle' superclass and derive 'Car' and 'Motorcycle' subclasses from it, inheriting common characteristics like 'speed' and 'fuel efficiency'.                                                    

                                                      Polymorphism

An object or reference can have distinct forms in various contexts. Polymorphism would be defined as "a property of having numerous forms" since, as the name suggests, "poly" denotes "many," and "morph" refers to "forms."
For instance, when a person says "drive," it means something different for each vehicle:

For a car, driving involves using a steering wheel, pedals, and gears.
For a bicycle, driving involves pedaling and steering.
For a truck, driving involves handling a larger steering wheel, shifting gears, and using pedals.
Despite the differences in how they operate, they all respond to the command "drive."
